20 page report on Linear Regression Modeling for a California Housing Dataset. Final project for Data Exploration and Analysis class at Yale. 

The accompanying R script delivers a thorough analysis of housing data, using methods like correlation analysis to explore relationships between variables and multiple linear regression to predict median house values. It includes ANOVA for comparing group means, applies Tukey's post-hoc tests for detailed comparisons, and uses stepwise regression to refine and improve the predictive models.
